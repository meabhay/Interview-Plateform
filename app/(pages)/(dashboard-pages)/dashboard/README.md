## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18.18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A PostgreSQL database. You can set one up for free on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Interview-Plateform.git
cd Interview-Plateform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, fill in the required values in the `.env` file. See the Environment Variables section below for details.

### 4. Run Database Migrations

Apply the database schema to your PostgreSQL database using Prisma.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Environment Variables

The following variables are required to run the application. Add them to your `.env` file:

```env
# Google OAuth Credentials (from Google Cloud Console)
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=

# NextAuth.js Configuration
AUTH_SECRET= # A random string for signing tokens, e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database Connection URL (from your PostgreSQL provider)
# Example for Supabase with connection pooling:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true"

# Google Gemini API Key (from Google AI Studio)
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=

# Vapi.ai API Key (from Vapi dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=

# SMTP for sending emails (e.g., using Gmail)
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM=
```

## Future Improvements

- **Real-time Notifications**: Inform users about scheduled interviews or new feedback.
- **Integrated Code Editor**: Allow candidates to solve coding problems in real-time during the interview.
- **Video Recording & Analysis**: Record interview sessions and analyze body language and speech patterns.
- **Company-Specific Tracks**: Create interview preparation tracks tailored to specific companies.
